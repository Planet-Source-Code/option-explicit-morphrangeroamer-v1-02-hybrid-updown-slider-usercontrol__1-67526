'* MorphRangeRoamer 1.02 - --->VB6<--- UpDown/Slider hybrid usercontrol. *
'* Author: Matthew R. Usner, Dec. 2006 for www.planet-source-code.com.   *
'* Last update 18 Feb 2007 - Added .UD_SwapDirections property.          *
'* The most up-to-date version of this control can always be found at:   *

'*************************************************************************
'* MorphRangeRoamer is my attempt to overcome the inadequacies of the    *
'* humble UpDown and Slider controls.  To a reasonable extent, I believe *
'* I succeeded.  I like the concept of the UpDown control but rarely use *
'* it.  Why?  Because it's realistically only useful for selecting among *
'* a small range of values, otherwise you're stuck clicking down on one  *
'* of the direction buttons forever waiting for the correct value.  Auto-*
'* matic value acceleration via the .Increment property helps, but not a *
'* great deal.  Usually I end up overshooting my target by a gazillion   *
'* and have to go back. The Slider, on the other hand, is good for huge  *
'* ranges, but only if it takes up a lot of screen space.  Tweaking it   *
'* to narrow it down to a specific value is a pain. MorphRangeRoamer is  *
'* an UpDown/Slider hybrid that tries to improve the efficiency of both  *
'* controls by having them seamlessly work together.  Both small and     *
'* large ranges of values are handled easily. At first, MorphRangeRoamer *
'* acts much like a typical VB UpDown.  Click the up or down buttons to  *
'* increase or decrease the .Value property. Click and hold on one of    *
'* the direction buttons and the .Value will increment or decrement at   *
'* definable rates of speed.  You can set properties that control the    *
'* size of the value increment when the Ctrl, Shift, or both keys are    *
'* held down while clicking the UpDown buttons.  For example, the default*
'* increment could be 1, the increment while holding Ctrl could be 10,   *
'* while holding Shift 100, and Ctrl-Shift 1000.  This helps you navigate*
'* through large ranges much more efficiently than a regular UpDown. For *
'* larger ranges, after a definable time interval clicking and holding   *
'* down an UpDown button, a Slider-esque "RangeWindow" appears.  By keep-*
'* ing the mouse button held down, and moving the mouse right or left in *
'* the progress bar, you can instantly move anywhere in the value range. *
'* The progress bar and LED display in the RangeWindow let you keep      *
'* track of where you are in the value range you have defined in the     *
'* appropriate properties.  When you're close to (or at) the value you   *
'* want, release the mouse button.  The RangeWindow disappears and you   *
'* can click the up or down button a few times (using Shift and/or Ctrl  *
'* if necessary) until precisely the right value is chosen.  In this     *
'* fashion, you can use MorphRangeRoamer to very quickly navigate        *
'* through much larger value ranges than the intrinsic UpDown is capable *
'* of efficiently doing, with more precision than is convenient with the *
'* Slider.  There are some limitations; I am not trying to imply this    *
'* control is suitable for ranges in the billions, it's not.  Pixels     *
'* (RangeWindow operation) and ease of keyboard use (UpDown) prevent     *
'* that.  And as this is an early version, there is no BuddyControl      *
'* capability.  I may or may not add it; for now you'll have to emulate  *
'* BuddyControl functionality in your project's form code (which is what *
'* many coders do anyway).  But when you try this you'll see how much it *
'* outperforms the VB UpDown and Slider controls in many respects!       *

'  the UP button and the Y coordinate increases, and the picture therefore moves DOWN.  Not too
